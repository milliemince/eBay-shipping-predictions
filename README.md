# Predicting eBay Delivery Times 
## Project Description
Accurate predictions of product delivery times is a basic a crucial aspect of customer service for any company that deals with the transpoortation of goods from seller to buyer. For eBay, predicting delivery times is especially difficult because shipments are made by over 25 million individual sellers across the globe who have different preferred carrieres, as well as different levels of proactiveness to package and ship good shortly thereafter purchase. The range of goods sold on eBay along with the variety of sellers and buyers makes this problem especially interesting and challenging. The objective is to estimate the number of calendar days it will take for a buyer to receive the product after payment is made:

###payment date + handling time + transit time = delivery date 

The team will enter eBay's [evalAI Machine Learning competition](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1205/overview) to get access to a training dataset of over 15 million of eBay's shipping records.

##Goals
1. Compare different NN architectures to determine which best fits problem.
2. Determine most important features for prediction (1) handling time and (2) transit time
3. Build an accurate model that can realistically be used by eBay!
